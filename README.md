The matrix\_encryption.js file encrypts a message (written in letters, numbers, and basic punctuation) into a string of numbers in the terminal. It uses matrix multiplication (see https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Applied\_Mathematics/Applied\_Finite\_Mathematics\_(Sekhon\_and\_Bloom)/02%3A\_Matrices/2.05%3A\_Application\_of\_Matrices\_in\_Cryptography). Once the message is encrypted, only someone who has the matrix key can easily decrypt the original message.



This project is practice in writing JavaScript.
